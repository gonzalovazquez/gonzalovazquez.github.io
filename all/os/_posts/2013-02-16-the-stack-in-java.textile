The JVM divided the memory into following sections.

# Heap
# Stack
# Code
# Static

The stack is a very organized area in the computerâ€™s memory where we store local variables. A local variable is a variable created in the currently executing code block. The variables are stored by the thread of execution, meaning from the first line to the last one.

Let me show you how it works. First we are going to look at the program below and store the local variable in the stack as the computer would.

<pre name="code" class="java">
public class Stack
{
    public static void main (String [] args)
    {
    int length = 5;
    int width = 10;

    int area = length * width;
    System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is " + area );
    }
}
</pre>

On the stack side it would look like this:

h4. Stack

* length  = 5
* width  = 10
* area   = 15
* PrgCtr

First we store the local variables the we hit "System.out.print" and we exit the stack and the class.
