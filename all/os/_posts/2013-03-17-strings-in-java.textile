Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming language, strings are objects.

Just remember, a string is NOT a primitive data type but rather is an object that contains a string of characters.

Letâ€™s take a look at it in a class.

<pre name="code" class="java">
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class MakingStrings
{
   public static void main (String [] args)
   {
    String outputString = "some text";
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, myString);
    // Will print " some text " .
   }
}
</pre>
