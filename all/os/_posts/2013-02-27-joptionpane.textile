What is JOptionPane? It is a class that lives in the Java API that always the java program to pop-up a window and alert the user. We are going to use it a lot so let me go through the syntax.

<pre name="code" class="java">
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class Example
{
   public static void main (String [] args)
   {
    //Instantiate and give it a variable of IO
    JOptionPane myIO = new JOptionPane();
    myIO.showMessageDialog(null, "Hello World");

    //Short form
    showMessageDialog(null, " Another Hello");
   }
}
</pre>

The first thing we have is an import statement to the JOptionPane object that lives under
the Swing class in the Java API.

Later on, we give it instantiate the JOptionPane object and give it a variable of "myIO", which we can use over and over again.

That is the basic use of JOptionPane, and it is mainly used to display pop-up messages.
