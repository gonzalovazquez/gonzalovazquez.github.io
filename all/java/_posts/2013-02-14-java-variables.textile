Variables are useful to store information that later we can use. 
In order to use a variable first we must declare them. 

We start with the type of variable followed by the variable name and itâ€™s value.

The following are some variables that we can use.

<pre name="code" class="java">
public class Variable
{
    public static void main (String [] args)
    {
      byte variable1;
      // Can store -128 to 128
      short variable2;
      // Can store -32768 to 32768
      int variable3;
      // Can store 2147483684 to 2147483684
      long variable4;
      //Can store really huge numbers
      float variable5;
      // Can store large decimal range
      double variable6;
      // Can store huge decimal range
     }
}
</pre>

The following class will make the use of variables to print the area of a rectangle.

<pre name="code" class="java">
public class Area
{
    public static void main (String [] args)
    {
    int length = 5;
    int width = 10;

    int area = length * width;
    System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is " + area );
    }
}
</pre>

If we see under "System.out.println" we can see how we let the variables do the work.
