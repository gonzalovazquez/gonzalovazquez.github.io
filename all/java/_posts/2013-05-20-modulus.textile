Is the extra amount left from dividing two numbers together.

For example:

* 7 % 2 = 1

* 2 % 2 = 1

* 3 % 2 = 1

* 15 % 7 = 1

* 9 % 10 = 9

* 99 % 99 = 0

Another way to look at it is.

What is 12 / 5 is 2 and the remainder is 2, because 5 goes into 12 two times and is left with 2.

In conclusion : 

12 % 5 = 2

Modulus can come in real handy when you are building applications.
