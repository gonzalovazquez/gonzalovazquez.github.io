Now what happens if we want to store an double in a integer. The program will give us an error because the double wont fit in the integer so the solution? Casting.

The following we are casting a double into an integer.

<pre name="code" class="java">
	int myVar = (int) myDouble;
</pre>

When casting from one type to another, always use the type that you are converting to as the cast.
