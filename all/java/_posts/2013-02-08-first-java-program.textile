Requirements:

* Java SE
* Dr. JAVA 


Let's make our first program. Look at the code below, and I will explain line by line.

<pre name="code" class="java">
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main (String [] args)
     {
         System.out.println("Hello World");
     }
}
</pre>

Let me explain what we wrote above. 

Line 1 is our  Class Header.

Everything between line 2 to line 6 is our class.

Inside our class on line 3 we have our method header.

In between line 4 and line 6 we have our method.

Keep in mind:

* Always start your class with capitals and save it as the same name (Eg. HelloWorld.java)
* Every Java program has at least one class.
* A class is the building block of object oriented programming.
* Every piece of code exists inside a class.
* Case is very important in java.
* Spaces are also important in java.
