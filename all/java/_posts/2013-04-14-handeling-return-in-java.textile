First we are going to build a calling class called Rectangle with a method called showArea. Pay close attention to the syntax of this method and see the difference.

<pre name="code" class="java">
public class Rectangle
{
  public int length;
  public int width;
 
  public int showArea()
  {
  int area = length * width;
  //Return the result
  return area;
  }
}
</pre>

Now that we are returning a value "area", we have to make our main class able to capture it. 

How do we do this? Like so.

<pre name="code" class="java">
public class testRectangle
{
   public static void main (String [] args)
   {
   Rectangle myObj = new Rectangle();
   //Set the values of the rectangle
   myObj.length = 45;
   mObj.width = 28;
   //We make a local variable to store the return
   int area = myObj.showArea();
   //Output
   System.out.println("The area is "+ area);
   }
}
</pre>

This way we are able to capture the return value from our calling class and set it to the local variable called area

We are also able to pass variables into our methods not only return variables.
