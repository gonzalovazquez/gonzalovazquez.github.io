If you where you write this class into your code editor and run it you would be greeted with a box and a user input line. Very neat indeed. Let me show you the code.

<pre name="code" class="java">
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class GetUserInput
{
   public static void main (String [] args)
   {
   String myInput = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Type your name");
   JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your name is " + myInput);
   //Output: Whatever the user typed plus the string Your name is.
   }
}
</pre>

Now we have the capacity of asking user for information, very very powerful indeed. 

However their is a catch with this method. 

JOptionPane will take whatever the user typed and convert it into a string, so if we want to maybe accept an integer it won't be possible unless we convert it back to an integer from a string.
