A try statement is used to catch exceptions that might be thrown as your program executes. You should use a try statement whenever you use a statement that might throw an exception That way, your program wonâ€™t crash if the exception occurs.

<pre name="code" class="java">
try
   {
  //risky code in here
   }
  catch(Exception err)
   {
  //code to handle any exceptions
  finally
   }
  //code that runs no matter what
   }
  </pre>

h4. Inside try:

If any of the code inside the try code-block causes an exception, execution immediately jumps to the catch code-block and passes the exception object as an argument.

h4. Inside catch:

We write the code in this block to handle the error gracefully or to throw an exception.

h4. Inside finally:

No matter what happens, the finally block of code always runs.

Another quick thing I want to mention is you can make custom errors. You have access to a class code Illegal Argument Expection that will stop the Java program and throw an error. 

Following is the syntax:

<pre name="code" class="java">

IllegalArgumentException error = new IllegalArgumentException("ERROR!!");

throw error;

</pre>
