Booleans are very powerful. They can either evaluate as true or false. 

h4. Comparison Operators:

* < less than

* > greater than

* <= less than or equal to

* >= greater than or equal to

* == equal to

* != equal to

* ! = not

h4. Logic Operators:

* && AND

* || OR

* ! NOT

Now that we know booleans, comparison and logic operators we can put them all together to create an if statement.

The following are examples of if statements.

*if (myNumber > 10 && myNumber < 20)*

If myNumber is greater than 10 AND if myNumber is less than 20 then wrote code.

*if (myNumber > 10 || myNumber < 20)*

If myNumber is greater than 10 OR if myNumber is less than 20 then wrote code.

Remember that if statements allow us to test for certain conditions within our code using boolean expressions.

Let see how that looks in code.

<pre name="code" class="java">
if( //boolean expression  )
    {
    //code that runs if the boolean expression
    //evaluates to true.
    }
else if ( //boolean expression #2  ) 
    {
    //code that runs if boolean
    //expression evaluates to false
    // and boolean expression #2 true
    }
else
    {
    //code that runs if both are false
    }
</pre>

That is a simple if statement in java code. 

If statements can get very lengthy and complex so we can use something called a switch statement to ease our typing.
