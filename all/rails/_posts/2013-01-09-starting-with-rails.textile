<p><strong>Who Should Use Ruby on Rails ?</strong></p>
<p>Developers who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have previous web experience</li>
<li>Build sites that interact with databases</li>
<li>Are tired of creating and recreating site functionality from scratch</li>

<p><strong>MVC Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Stands for<strong> M</strong>odel<strong> V</strong>iew<strong> C</strong>ontroller</p>
<p>The Model is our objects. It's the object-oriented approach design and it's actually encapsulates the data in our database.</p>
<p>The View is the presentation layer. It's the web pages, the HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript.</p>
<p>The controller is going to process and respond to events such as user actions and it's going to invoke changes to the model and the view based on that.</p>
<p>Here is a visual representation of the MVC Structure.</p>
<p><img alt="MVC" height="185" src="/images/mvc.png" width="583" /></p>
<p>We want to follow this architecture and keep our code in the right places. Rails has name for this.</p>
<p>Controller = ActionController</p>
<p>View = ActionView</p>
<p>Model = ActiveRecord</p>
