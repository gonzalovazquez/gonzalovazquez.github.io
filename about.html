<p>
	My name is Gonzalo. I am a full-stack developer passionate about building and creating change. I spend most of my time coding, thinking about code, and learning code. 
</p>
<p>
My yearning to understand the world and the power to create magnificent things within it is the reason my skill set has evolved to a comprehensive level, which includes versatility with things ranging from front-end and back-end to, my new love, mobile development.

<p> I would like to thank Dan Hixon for the inspiration of this site.</p>
